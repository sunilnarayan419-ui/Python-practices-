Indentation

I learned a language
that doesn’t shout with braces,
doesn’t lock meaning inside {}.

It whispers.

A space forward,
and suddenly you belong.
A space back,
and you’re on your own.

An if waits patiently,
a for walks in rhythm,
a def opens a small room
where ideas live together.

One wrong step,
and the language stops—
not angry,
just honest.

“Be clear,” it says.
“Be consistent.”

Because in this world,
how you stand
decides who you are with.

And somehow…
that feels less like code,
and more like life.
